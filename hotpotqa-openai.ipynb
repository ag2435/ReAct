      "Observation 3: The Ordnance QF Hotchkiss 6 pounder gun Mk I and Mk II or QF 6 pounder 8 cwt were a family of long-lived light 57 mm naval guns introduced in 1885 to defend against new, small and fast vessels such as torpedo boats and later submarines. There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",

Despite Missouri wanting to continue athletic competition, no further regular season games were scheduled between the two schools for several years.[4] However, the two schools played an exhibition game in men's basketball on October 22, 2017, with Kansas defeating Missouri 93–87.\n",

      "Observation 1: John Henry O'Hara (January 31, 1905 – April 11, 1970) was one of America's most prolific writers of short stories, credited with helping to invent The New Yorker magazine short story style.[1] He became a best-selling novelist before the age of 30 with Appointment in Samarra and BUtterfield 8. While O'Hara's legacy as a writer is debated, his work was praised by such contemporaries as Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald, and his champions rank him highly among the major under-appreciated American writers of the 20th century.[2][3][4] Few college students educated after O'Hara's death in 1970 have discovered him, chiefly because he refused to allow his work to be reprinted in anthologies used to teach literature at the college level.. \"O’Hara may not have been the best story writer of the twentieth century, but he is the most addictive,\" wrote Lorin Stein, then editor-in-chief of The Paris Review, in a 2013 appreciation of O'Hara's work. Stein added, \"You can binge on his collections the way some people binge on Mad Men, and for some of the same reasons.\n",

The dictator game is a derivative of the ultimatum game, in which one player (the proposer) provides a one-time offer to the other (the responder). The responder can choose to either accept or reject the proposer's bid, but rejecting the bid would result in both players receiving a payoff of 0.

The story is based loosely on the life of the French poet André Chénier (1762–1794), who was executed during the French Revolution. The character Carlo Gérard is partly based on Jean-Lambert Tallien, a leading figure in the Revolution. It remains popular with audiences, though less frequently performed than in the first half of the 20th century. One reason for its survival in the repertoire is the lyrical-dramatic music provided by Giordano for the tenor lead, which gives a talented singer opportunities to demonstrate his skills and flaunt his voice.\n",

The cosmopolitan is a relative of cranberry coolers like the Cape Codder.[1][2] Though often presented far differently, the cosmopolitan also bears a likeness in composition to the kamikaze cocktail.. The International Bartenders Association recipe is based on vodka citron, lemon-flavored vodka.[3] The use of citrus-flavored vodka as the basis for this cocktail appears to have been widely popularized in the mid-1990s by cocktail expert Dale DeGroff[4] and is used in the IBA-approved recipe. Many bartenders, however, continue to use a standard unflavored vodka — this alternative would undoubtedly be historically consistent with any of the supposed predecessors of this drink that were popular in Ohio, Provincetown, or Minneapolis during the 1970s, or in San Francisco during the 1980s.[5][6][7][8] A lemon twist is sometimes used to garnish.. The cosmopolitan is usually served in a large cocktail glass, also called a martini glass.\n",

The name Tibouchina is adapted from a Guianan indigenous name for a member of this genus.[3] A systematic study in 2013 showed that as then circumscribed the genus was paraphyletic,[4] and in 2019 the genus was split into a more narrowly circumscribed Tibouchina, two re-established genera Pleroma and Chaetogastra, and a new genus, Andesanthus.[9].

The song draws its title from Charley Patton's \"High Water Everywhere\", and is meant as a tribute to that bluesman[5] although Dylan scholar Tony Attwood notes that the song, both musically and lyrically, has little point of contact with the original Patton work.[6]. Lyrically, \"High Water (For Charley Patton)\" is similar to Dylan's 1983 song \"Blind Willie McTell\"[7] and his 2020 song \"Goodbye Jimmy Reed\"[8] in that it pays tribute to the titular blues singer only indirectly.

Based on a real-life story, the film centers on a taxi driver from Seoul who unintentionally becomes involved in the events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980. It is based on German journalist Jürgen Hinzpeter's interactions with driver Kim Sa-bok; however, as very little information on Kim was  known at the time the film was made, most elements regarding his life and the events that happened to him outside of Gwangju are fictional.. The film was released on 2 August 2017, in South Korea.[6] It was very positively received by critics, who praised its unique approach to depicting the Gwangju Uprising events, emotional weight, as well as the main character and his relationship with Hinzpeter, and was selected as the South Korean entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards.[7][8] The film was a notable commercial success: it was the second highest-grossing film of 2017 in South Korea, and currently stands as the thirteenth highest-grossing South Korean film in history.[9][10]. The film centers around the Gwangju Uprising that occurred from 18 May 1980, to 27 May 1980, and it is estimated to have led to 2,000 people being killed.\n",

It was first published in the Beirut journal Hiwâr. The main concern of the novel is with the impact of British colonialism and European modernity on rural African societies in general and Sudanese culture and identity in particular.[1] His novel reflects the conflicts of modern Sudan and depicts the brutal history of European colonialism as shaping the reality of contemporary Sudanese society. Damascus-based Arab Literary Academy named it one of the best novels in Arabic of the twentieth century. Mawsim al-Hijrah ilâ al-Shamâl is considered to be an important turning point in the development of postcolonial narratives that focus on the encounter between East and West.[1].\n",

He has been controversial for alleged domestic violence, though he denies the allegations.. Stza was raised in New York by his mother, who he classified as an \"over-protective Jewish mom\". He rarely saw his biological father, and his stepfather died by suicide.[2] As a teenager, he dropped out of high school, ran away from home, and began riding freight trains.[3] During this time, he began using heroin and crack cocaine. He later described drugs as a positive influence in his life and said that he would have killed himself during this time if not for drugs because he was \"very lonely and suicidal.\"[4].\n",

The play premiered in 1952 on BBC Television,[5] before being performed on stage in the same year in London's West End in June, and then New York's Broadway in October.. Originally intended to be shown in dual-strip polarized 3-D, the film played in most theatres in ordinary 2-D due to the loss of interest in the 3-D process (the projection of which was difficult and error-prone) by the time of its release.[6] The film earned an estimated $2.7 million in North American box office sales in 1954.[7].
