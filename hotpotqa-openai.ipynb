Her other film appearances include The Secret Garden (1993), Beyond the Clouds (1995), U.S. Marshals (1998), and Eternity (2016).. Irène Jacob was born in Suresnes, Hauts-de-Seine, a western suburb of Paris.[3] The youngest child with three older brothers, she was raised in a highly educated and intellectual family and environment: her father, Maurice Jacob, was a physicist; her mother, a psychologist; one brother, Francis Jacob, a musician; and her other two brothers, scientists.[4][5] In 1969, at the age of three, Irène moved with her family to Geneva, Switzerland, where she became interested in the arts.. My family was very shy with feelings and never spoke about them, but we evolved a little bit.\n",

There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships. This led to their being used ashore during World War I as coastal defense guns, the first tank guns and as anti-aircraft guns, whether on improvised or specialized HA/LA mounts.\n",

There were many variants produced, often under license which ranged in length from 40 to 58 calibers, but 40 caliber was the most common version.. 6-pounders were widely used by the navies of a number of nations and often used by both sides in a conflict. Due to advances in torpedo delivery and performance, 6-pounder guns were rapidly made obsolete and were replaced with larger guns aboard most larger warships.

I should search for \"Hardley Flood\" to understand the context better and identify the animal in question.\\n\\nAction 1: Search[Hardley Flood]\\nObservation 1: Hardley Flood is a 49.8-hectare (123-acre) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest near Loddon, between Norwich, Lowestoft and Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.[1][2] It is part of the Broadland Ramsar site[3] and Special Protection Area,[4] and The Broads Special Area of Conservation.[5]. This area of tidal lagoons and reedbeds provides a spillway for the River Chet. The reedbeds provide nesting sites for birds, including nationally important populations of several breeding birds. Three rare flies have been recorded, Elachiptera uniseta, Elachiptera scrobiculata and Lonchoptera scutellata.[6]. The site is open to  the public..\\nThought 2: The passage about Hardley Flood mentions that it is an area of tidal lagoons and reedbeds that support populations of waterfowl. To find the medium-sized version of an animal, I should look for the specific mention of the animal\\'s description in the passage.\\n\\nAction 2: Lookup[medium-sized version]\\nObservation 2: No more results.\\n\\nThought 3: It seems like the specific mention of the medium-sized version of an animal is not directly available in the passage. To proceed, I will need to infer the answer based on the context provided.\\n\\nThought 4: Given that Hardley Flood supports populations of waterfowl, and the question mentions a medium-sized version of an animal, it is likely referring to a medium-sized waterfowl species. I will search for common medium-sized waterfowl species to determine the answer.\\n\\nAction 3: Search\\nObservation 3: Invalid action: search\\nThought 4: It seems like we have reached a point where we need to make an inference based on the information available. Considering that Hardley Flood supports populations of waterfowl and the question mentions a medium-sized version of an animal, it is reasonable to assume that the answer is related to a medium-sized waterfowl species. \\nAction 4: Finish[waterfowl]\\nObservation 4: Episode finished, reward = 0\\n\\n'},\n",
