      "Observation 1: The Laleli Mosque (Turkish: Laleli Camii, lit. 'Tulip Mosque') is an 18th-century Ottoman imperial mosque located in Laleli, Fatih, Istanbul, Turkey.[1]. The mosque was commissioned by Sultan Mustafa III to serve as his imperial or sultanic mosque.[2][3] Although it was tradition among earlier sultans to build their imperial mosque in commemoration of a major military success, Mustafa III ignored this tradition by ordering the construction before any such victories.[3] Construction began on 5 April 1760 and was completed on 9 March 1764.[4][3] According to a contemporary writer, the mosque was officially named Nur Mustafa ('Light of Mustafa'), but it became popularly known as the Laleli Mosque ('Mosque of the Tulips') after the name of the neighbourhood where it was built.[3]. The architect of the mosque is not confirmed by historical documentation, but art historians have attributed the mosque to Mehmed Tahir Agha, the chief imperial architect at the time of the mosque's completion.[a][2][4][5] On average, about 770 workers were employed in the project and about two thirds of them were non-Muslims, the rest being Muslim.[5]. The mosque was the centerpiece of a larger complex (külliye) that included the Mustafa III's tomb, a nearby caravanserai which provided some revenues to the complex, a sebil, and a madrasa.[6] Mustafa III was buried in the mausoleum attached to the complex after his death in 1774.[7] The mosque and its complex were damaged by the 1766 earthquake[4] and, according to Ünver Rüstem, by a fire in 1783.[7] In 1783 it was fully restored.[7][2] The restoration, which Doğan Kuban attributes to the architect Seyit Mustafa Agha,[4][2] preserved the original mosque's appearance.[7] The mausoleum's façade was updated with new marble window frames in the early 19th century.[6] The madrasa of the complex was destroyed by fire in 1911.[6]. The mosque was built in the Ottoman Baroque style of its time.[8][9][10] The layout is based on that of the earlier Selimiye Mosque of Edirne from the classical period, in accordance with Mustafa III's wishes.[11][5] The decoration of the mosque and its complex is firmly baroque.[12][2] The mosque incorporates thus the visual style of the earlier Nuruosmaniye Mosque – the first imperial mosque in the Ottoman Baroque style, completed by Mustafa III's predecessor – but in a more restrained way that integrates it with more traditional Ottoman architecture.[13].\n",

      "Observation 2: Edward Davis Wood Jr. (October 10, 1924 – December 10, 1978) was an American filmmaker, actor, screenwriter, and pulp novel author.. In the 1950s, Wood directed several low-budget science fiction, crime and horror films that later became cult classics, notably Glen or Glenda (1953), Jail Bait (1954), Bride of the Monster (1955), Plan 9 from Outer Space (1957)[1] and Night of the Ghouls (1959).[1] In the 1960s and 1970s, he moved towards sexploitation and pornographic films such as The Sinister Urge (1960), Orgy of the Dead (1965) and Necromania (1971), and wrote over 80 lurid pulp crime and sex novels.. Notable for their campy aesthetics, technical errors, unsophisticated special effects, use of poorly-matched stock footage, eccentric casts, idiosyncratic stories and non sequitur dialogue, Wood's films remained largely obscure until he was posthumously awarded a Golden Turkey Award for Worst Director of All Time in 1980, renewing public interest in his life and work.[2].

      "Observation 4: The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains, mainly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota, generally encompassing the western part of the Great Plains before the region reaches the Rocky Mountains. The High Plains are located in eastern Montana, southeastern Wyoming, southwestern South Dakota, western Nebraska, eastern Colorado, western Kansas, eastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma Panhandle, and the Texas Panhandle.[4] The southern region of the Western High Plains ecology region contains the geological formation known as Llano Estacado which can be seen from a short distance or on satellite maps.[5] From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130 m).[3]. The term \"Great Plains\", for the region west of about the 96th or 98th meridian and east of the Rocky Mountains, was not generally used before the early 20th century. Nevin Fenneman's 1916 study, Physiographic Subdivision of the United States,[6] brought the term Great Plains into more widespread usage. Prior to 1916, the region was almost invariably called the High Plains, in contrast to the lower Prairie Plains of the Midwestern states.[7] Today the term \"High Plains\" is usually used for a subregion instead of the whole of the Great Plains..\n",
